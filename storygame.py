//This program involves creating a fill in the blank word game. Try prompting the user to enter a noun, verb, and an adjective. 
//Use the provided responses to fill in the blanks and then display the story. 
//First, write a short story. Remove a noun, verb, and an adjective.
//Create a function that asks for input from the user.
//Create another function that will fill the blanks in the story youâ€™ve just created. Ensure that each function contains a docstring.
//After the noun, verb, and adjective have been collected from the user, display the story that has been created using their input
